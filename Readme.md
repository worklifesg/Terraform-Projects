## General info
This repository is on Terraform projects that I would like to practice and customize the solution to present the whole architecture pipeline clearly. Most of the work will involve around Terraform deployments where we have used AWS as a cloud provider. For more advanced topics, Terraform-Git Automation and Terraform Vault integration is also demostrated. In addition, if there is time we will implement Terraform with Git & Jenkins pipeline so that organizations where github workflows or bitbucket pipelines are not enabled, they can use Terraform with Jenkins
