## General info
This repository is on Terraform projects that I would like to practice and customize the solution to present the whole architecture pipeline clearly. 
* Most of the work will involve around Terraform deployments where we have used AWS as a cloud provider. 
* For more advanced topics, Terraform-Git Automation and Terraform Vault integration is also demostrated. 
* In addition, if there is time we will implement Terraform with Git & Jenkins pipeline so that organizations where github workflows or bitbucket pipelines are not enabled, they can use Terraform with Jenkins

## Quick Touchpoint on Terraform

In simple language (if you work in cloud infrastructure, you will get it !), **Terraform** is an IaC tool to **B**uild, **C**hange, & **V**ersion Infrastructure efficiently. It comes in three formats: CLI (open source), Cloud, & Enterprise version. Please visit at ![Terraform Docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs) for more information. In addition, you can find my Terraform notes in this repo.
